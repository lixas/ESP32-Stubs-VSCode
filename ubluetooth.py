    This module provides an interface to a Bluetooth controller on a board. Currently this supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in Central, Peripheral, Broadcaster, and Observer roles, and a device may operate in multiple roles concurrently.

    This API is intended to match the low-level Bluetooth protocol and provide building-blocks for higher-level abstractions such as specific device types.

    Returns

    - Singleton BLE object.

        ----------
        - str 'mac' : Returns the device MAC address. If a device has a fixed address (e.g. PYBD) then it will be returned. Otherwise (e.g. ESP32) a random address will be generated when the BLE interface is made active.

This buffer is global to the entire BLE driver and so handles incoming data for all events, including all characteristics. Increasing this allows better handling of bursty incoming data (for example scan results) and the ability for a central role to receive larger characteristic values.
